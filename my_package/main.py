"""
Main entry point for the application.

This module serves as the root Typer application that aggregates all command modules.
It demonstrates how to:
- Create a root Typer app that serves as the main CLI entry point
- Register sub-applications (commands) using add_typer()
- Configure logging with Rich for beautiful terminal output
- Set up global app configuration (no args shows help, completion disabled)
- Add a --version flag using a callback

The main app doesn't have its own commands - it only serves as a container for
sub-commands from other modules (hello, mail, etc.).
